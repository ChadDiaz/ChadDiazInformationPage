    <p> I've always enjoyed working on and playing with computers.  I find that I learn both the hardware and the software side of computers very easy.</p>
    
    <p> I've recently had a birthday and have found that I no longer enjoy what I've done for a living.  I've decided to start Lambda School to learn something that will help me change careers and be successful.</p>
